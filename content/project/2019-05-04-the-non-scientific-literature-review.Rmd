Reading classic literature / fiction is one of my all time favourite activities. My 
apartement is filled with books (yes - the old-fashioned printed book `r emo::ji("book")`) 
and I treasure the moments when I can sit somewhere quiet and just enjoy reading.  

This post contains an incomplete list of books I've read. Some were better than others, some are 
very famous, some are funny and some are sad but all of them accompanied me at some point in 
my life.  

For each book I give the sentence(s) that made the book stay in my mind.
