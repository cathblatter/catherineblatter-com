**What is it about?**

Some of my recent work includes writing the [shurp2018-package](https://cathblatter.github.io/shurp2018). 

This R package contains all the functions used to produce descriptive reports for a study called SHURP2018 - a research project at the Institute of Nursing Science. More information is found here: https://shurp.unibas.ch
