<p>Reading classic literature / fiction is one of my all time favourite activities. My
apartement is filled with books (yes - the old-fashioned printed book ðŸ“–)
and I treasure the moments when I can sit somewhere quiet and just enjoy reading.</p>
<p>This post contains an incomplete list of books Iâ€™ve read. Some were better than others, some are
very famous, some are funny and some are sad but all of them accompanied me at some point in
my life.</p>
<p>For each book I give the sentence(s) that made the book stay in my mind.</p>
