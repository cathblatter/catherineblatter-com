Hi, my name is Catherine Blatter 👋

I am a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland - during my
master’s studies at the [Institute of Nursing Science in
Basel](https://nursing.unibas.ch) I discovered a passion for coding in
\#rstats.

  - 🏥 my clinical interests lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical
    nursing, more specifically general and thoracic surgery.

  - 👴 my research interest is health services research - currently
    mostly with data from nursing homes.
