# Motivation

This post should really just be a random list of things that R can do but I 
often forget about....


## Print calendar in R console

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# spoiler : code copied from @grrrick at 
# https://github.com/gadenbuie/garrickadenbuie-com/blob/main/content/blog/2020/2020-09-21-a-calendar-in-your-r-console.Rmarkdown
system <- function(...) {
  x <- base::system(..., intern = TRUE)
  cat(gsub("_\b", "", x), sep = "\n")
}
```

```{r echo=TRUE, comment=""}
system("cal")
```

Because, why not? `r emo::ji("sunglasses")` It even goes for a whole year:  

```{r echo=TRUE, comment=""}
system("cal 2021")
```
