## What is this post about?

- For my master's thesis (stay tuned `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`) I came at 
a point where I was interested in having a closer look at publication meta data (e.g. publications per year)  

- PubMed usually does provide this service when you execute your search, for some reason it failed
for my query

- Being taught basic statistics I was determined to find a way to create
the image myself... and came across the amazing RISmed-`r emo::ji("package")`

`r emo::ji("right_arrow")` This blog post highlights how I used the RISmed package
and gives short code examples 


## Introduction - what were the problems I faced?

The topic of my master's thesis - *unfinished / missed / rationed nursing care* - is an 
important topic in health services research with growing numbers of publications over 
the last years. Altough I did not have to use R extensively during my thesis, in one 
specific case I greatly profited from it: 

Usually, PubMed provides a small graphical display of the yearly publication
count on each query as shown in the image below: 

![PubMed year count](/images/pubmed_yearcount.png)

For some reason it failed for my exact search query. This was especially bad 
because I had to make a somehow valid statement that the publication numbers were 
increasing over the last years. 
If I only could get all meta data (i.e. years) from my query (~900) into a spreadsheet...[^1]

[^1]: Actually, PubMed does provide this service in a user friendly way: Execute your 
search query, choose the results you want, then go to *Send to* -> *File* and you 
get a .csv-file.  
But hey, who does it this way when you can extract it with an
R package?

At some point I realized that the PubMed database should be accessible and I was sure 
that R has a solution to it - that's how I found the [RISmed-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RISmed/RISmed.pdf).

## RISmed package

In short: the RISmed package provides functions to extract bibliographic information from  
the NCBI databases. In other words: you can extract the information from PubMed through 
R code - exactly what I needed! 

### How to use RISmed?

First you need to install `install.packages("RISmed")` or load the package: 

```{r}
# load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(RISmed)
```

Then you specify the search_topic and search_query: 

```{r}
# build the search topic
search_topic <- 'missed care [TI] OR implicit rationing [TI] OR unfinished care [TI]'

# the EUtilsSummary()-function gets information on your search results
# (maximum results set as 1000, years between 1980 and 2019)
search_query <- EUtilsSummary(search_topic, retmax=1000, mindate=1980,maxdate=2019)
```

`summary()` and `QueryId` get you quick overview of your results:  

```{r}
# Printing the summary displays the actual results that are available
summary(search_query)

# see the PMIIDs of our returned query
QueryId(search_query)

```

If you think your query gets you a reasonable number of results you can then 
further information on your records (i.e. dowloading the information): 

```{r}
# get the actual data from PubMed and store them in an object called records
records <- EUtilsGet(search_query, type = "efetch", db = "pubmed")

# check what kind of object "records" is
class(records)
```

For creating your final dataframe to analyse the data, you need to extract information 
as requested. You can choose either dataframe or list to store the results. Careful: 
If you extract `Author()` you need to choose list, otherwise the variable is dropped.

```{r}
# store it in either list or dataframe (Author() returns a list, therefore 
# list chosen here)
pubmed_data_list <- list('Title' = ArticleTitle(records), 
                         'Authors' = Author(records), 
                         'Year' = YearPubmed(records), 
                         'Journal' = Title(records),
                         'PublicationType' = PublicationType(records),
                         'Language' = Language(records))

# version without Authors for dataframe
pubmed_data <- data.frame('Title' = ArticleTitle(records),
                    'Year' = YearPubmed(records), 
                    'Journal' = Title(records),
                    'Language' = Language(records))
```

Finally, I could visually explore the year count: 

```{r}
# plot the yearcount
ggplot(pubmed_data, aes(x = factor(Year))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_discrete() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "No. of publications") +
  theme_classic()

```

## How could my thesis profit from the RISmed package? 

The figure I created[^2] helped me visualize meta information on the publications: 
I could clearly see that the topic *unfinished nursing care* has been mentioned 
with increasing tendency in publications. This gave me valid data for accepting my assumption.  

[^2]: (not the figure above, as the sample string I used in this post 
was not as comprehensive as the full search string used in my thesis)

Due to the nature of my thesis, I (sadly) didn't have to use the exact numbers. Yet, I still 
learned two useful things `r emo::ji("bulb")`:  

1) Using bibliographic information to inform your research may be helpful and should 
not be forgotten.  

2) I felt like I reached a whole new level of R's numerous capabilities: Using an 
R package to connect to a web-database should not be the end of my discoveries `r emo::ji("smiley")`


*Notes on this post*:  

- Be careful with the search query - there can be differences in using different codes, see here: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32994991/r-package-rismed-different-results-using-the-eutilsget-or-summary-function

- Dowloading information from PubMed (`EUtilsGet()`) can take a while

- I had some trouble with long search terms (no further explanation found)
