## What is this post about?

- For my master's thesis (blogpost following - stay tuned `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`) I came at 
a point where I was interested in having a closer look at publication meta data (e.g. publications per year)  

- PubMed usually does provide this service when you execute your search, for some reason it failed
for my query

- Being taught basic statistics I was determined to find a way to create
the image myself... and came across the amazing RISmed-`r emo::ji("package")`

`r emo::ji("right_arrow")` This blog post highlights two cases where I used RISmed 
and gives short code examples 


## Introduction - what were the problems I faced?

The topic of my master's thesis - *unfinished / missed / rationed nursing care* - is an 
important topic in health services research with growing numbers of publications over 
the last years. Altough I did not have to use R extensively during my thesis, in two 
situations I greatly profited from it: 

Usually, PubMed provides a small graphical display of the yearly publication
count on each query as shown in the image below: 

![PubMed year count](/images/pubmed_yearcount.png)

For some reason it failed for my exact search query. This was especially bad 
because I had to make a somehow valid statement that the publication numbers were growing. 
If I only could get all meta data (i.e. years) from my query (~900) into a spreadsheet... 

At a later stage of my thesis we came across the decision of the target journal for 
dissemination of the results, so my supervisor said something along the lines of 
"check out what journals usually publish your topic". Being trained for some years now that 
all statements should be appropriately referenced (i.e. no "guessing") I thought 
about analysing meta data (i.e. journal names) of these publications. At some point 
I realized that the PubMed database should be accessible and I was sure that R has a solution to it -
that's how I found the [RISmed-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RISmed/RISmed.pdf).

## RISmed package

In short: the RISmed package provides functions to extract bibliographic information from  
the NCBI databases. In other words: you can extract the information from PubMed through 
R code - exactly what I needed! 

### How to use RISmed?

First you need to install `install.packages("RISmed")` or load the package: 

```{r}
# load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(RISmed)
```

Then you specify the search_topic and search_query: 

```{r}
# build the search topic
search_topic <- 'missed care [TI] OR implicit rationing [TI] OR unfinished care [TI]'

# the EUtilsSummary()-function gets information on your search results
# (maximum results set as 1000, years between 1980 and 2019)
search_query <- EUtilsSummary(search_topic, retmax=1000, mindate=1980,maxdate=2019)
```

`summary()` and `QueryId` get you quick overview of your results:  

```{r}
# Printing the summary displays the actual results that are available
summary(search_query)

# see the PMIIDs of our returned query
QueryId(search_query)

```

If you think your query gets you a reasonable number of results you can then 
furter information on your records (i.e. dowloading the information): 

```{r}
# get the actual data from PubMed and store them in an object called records
records <- EUtilsGet(search_query, type = "efetch", db = "pubmed")

# check what kind of object "records" is
class(records)
```

For creating your final dataframe to analyse the data, you need to extract information 
as requested. You can choose either dataframe or list to store the results. Careful: 
If you extract `Author()` you need to choose list, otherwise the variable is dropped.

```{r}
# store it in either list or dataframe (Author() returns a list, therefore 
# list chosen here)
pubmed_data_list <- list('Title' = ArticleTitle(records), 
                         'Authors' = Author(records), 
                         'Year' = YearPubmed(records), 
                         'Journal' = Title(records),
                         'PublicationType' = PublicationType(records),
                         'Language' = Language(records))

# version without Authors for dataframe
pubmed_data <- data.frame('Title' = ArticleTitle(records),
                    'Year' = YearPubmed(records), 
                    'Journal' = Title(records),
                    'Language' = Language(records))
```

Finally, I could visually explore the year count: 

```{r}
# plot the yearcount
ggplot(pubmed_data, aes(x = factor(Year))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_discrete() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "No. of publications") +
  theme_classic()

```


*Notes*:  

- Be careful with the search query - there can be differences in using different codes, see here: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32994991/r-package-rismed-different-results-using-the-eutilsget-or-summary-function

- Dowloading information from PubMed (`EUtilsGet()`) can take a while

- I had some trouble with long search terms (no further explanation found)
