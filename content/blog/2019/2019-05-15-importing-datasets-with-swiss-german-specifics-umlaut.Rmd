This blog post is part of the ongoing collection *Data preparation series*. It collects
hints for preparation of data by some of the ongoing multi-center projcets at the [Institute of Nursing Science](https://nursing.unibas.ch).


# Why is this needed?

- Many ongoing projects at INS are multi-center studies combining both survey- 
and routinely collected data

- Most of them have data coming from at least two different language 
 regions (German- and French-speaking, eventually Italian-speaking)

- Importing those datasets in R with the systems default encoding by locale (UTF-8) fails often

`r emo::ji("right_arrow")` This blog post shows code for proper importing of datasets that contain umlaute (ä, ö, ü)  `r emo::ji("left_arrow")` 


# How to do it?

The trick is very easy: inside the function that imports the dataset into the global 
environment you need to change the encoding (from standard UTF-8) by setting your *locale* to **latin1**.

My favourite way to import (middle sized .csv-files) is with the readr-`r emo::ji("package")`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# this approach loads the whole readr-package
library(readr)
my_data <- read_delim("path/to/my/file/my_data.csv", delim = ";",
                      locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"))

# this approach does not load readr, but calls read_delim() from the readr-package
my_data <- readr::read_delim("path/to/my/file/my_data.csv", delim = ";",
                      locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"))

```


`r emo::ji("warning")` with the readr-package the encoding is spelt *latin1*, but sometimes the spelling can differ:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# attaching the package
library(data.table)
my_very_large_data <- fread("path/to/my/verylargefile/my_very_large_data.csv", 
                            sep = ";", encoding="Latin-1")

# calling the function directly
my_very_large_data <- data.table::fread("path/to/my/verylargefile/my_very_large_data.csv", 
                                        sep = ";", encoding="Latin-1")

```

\\

# Alternative way using RStudio's UI

1. Hit *Import Dataset* -> *From Text (readr)*

![](/images/1.png)

2. Choose *configure*, then *encoding* (see, the default is UTF-8)

![](/images/2.png)

3. Hit *other* and a new popup opens

![](/images/3.png)

4. Type "latin1", press *ok* - the popup closes - then choose *configure*

5. RStudios import panel changed the code preview - done :-)

`r emo::ji("bulb")` nice feature: if you hit import, the code is displayed 
in the console and you can copy/paste it into your .R-script. If I dont know the 
exact code, this is exactly what I do as a workaround!

Did that work out for you? Please contact me if something is not clear!
