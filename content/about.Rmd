Hi, my name is Catherine Blatter `r emo::ji("wave")`

I am a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland - during my master's studies at the [Institute of Nursing Science in Basel](https://nursing.unibas.ch) I discovered a passion for coding in #rstats.  

 - `r emo::ji("hospital")` my clinical interests lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical nursing, 
 more specifically general and thoracic surgery.
 
 - `r emo::ji("older_man")` my research interest is health services research - currently mostly with data from nursing homes.
