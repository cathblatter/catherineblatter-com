My name is Catherine Blatter and I am trained as a registered nurse (RN). I work as a research assistant at the [Institute of Nursing Science](https://nursing.unibas.ch) (INS) at the University of Basel where I'm wrangling data for several projects.  I'm striving to write safe and reproducible code.
