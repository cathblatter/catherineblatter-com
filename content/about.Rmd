My name is Catherine Blatter and I am trained as a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland. 
I'm currently finishing my Master's degree and working as a research assistant at the [Institute of 
Nursing Science](https://nursing.unibas.ch) (INS) at the University of Basel.  


- `r emo::ji("hospital")` My clinical interests and expertise lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical nursing, more specifically general, thoracic and neurosurgery in a tertiary center

- `r emo::ji("older_man")` `r emo::ji("older_woman")` I also enjoyed working in a more rural 
regional hospital with mostly older & chronically ill patients - in particular because "choosing wisely" was very popular and discussed often with patients and family members.

- `r emo::ji("computer")` During my master's studies and work at INS I discovered a passion for coding in #rstats. 
 
- `r emo::ji("chart_with_upwards_trend")` My research interest lies in quality of care in health services research. More precisely how data can be used to improve quality of care and account for the physical and emotional health of health care workers.
 

This website is mantained personally and does not represent my employer's views. It is a result of learning about Git (version control), writing R packages and lots of other useful stuff for R.
