I'm a registered-nurse-turned-data-lover working as a PhD student and 
research assistant at the Institute of Nursing Science
at the University of Basel, Switzerland. I like to build and hack code 
to make research faster, less ambiguous, more reproducible and to
generate meaningful data insights and outputs for use in clinical settings.
