My name is Catherine Blatter and I am trained as a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland. 
I work as a research assistant at the [Institute of Nursing Science](https://nursing.unibas.ch) (INS) at the University of Basel where I'm wrangling data for several projects.  

This website is mantained personally and does not represent my employer's views. It is a result of learning about Git (version control), writing R packages and lots of other useful stuff for R.
