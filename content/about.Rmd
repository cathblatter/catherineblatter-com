My name is Catherine Blatter and I am a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland.  

- `r emo::ji("hospital")` My clinical interests and expertise lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical nursing, more specifically general, thoracic and neurosurgery in a tertiary center

- `r emo::ji("older_man")` `r emo::ji("older_woman")` I also enjoyed working in a more rural 
regional hospital with mostly older & chronically ill patients - in particular because (in
my very own experience) patients and families have been more involved in any
decision making and "choosing wisely" was very popular.

During my master's studies and work at the [Institute of Nursing Science in Basel](https://nursing.unibas.ch) I discovered a passion for coding in #rstats. 
 
 - `r emo::ji("computer")` `r emo::ji("chart_with_upwards_trend")` My research interest lies in quality of care in health services research - especially by the use of data to improve quality of care and the physical and emotional health of health care workers.
