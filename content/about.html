<p>I’m a registered-nurse-turned-data-lover who works as a PhD student and
research assistant at the Institute of Nursing Science
at the University of Basel, Switzerland. I like to build and hack code
to make research faster, safer and more reproducible - and to generate meaningful
data insights and outputs for the clinical setting.</p>
