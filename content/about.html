<p>My name is Catherine Blatter and I am trained as a registered nurse (RN). I work as a research assistant at the <a href="https://nursing.unibas.ch">Institute of Nursing Science</a> (INS) at the University of Basel where I’m wrangling data for several projects. I’m striving to write safe and reproducible code.</p>
