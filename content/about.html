<p>Hi, my name is Catherine Blatter 👋</p>
<p>I am a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland - during my master’s studies at the <a href="https://nursing.unibas.ch">Institute of Nursing Science in Basel</a> I discovered a passion for coding in #rstats.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>🏥 my clinical interests lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical nursing,
more specifically general and thoracic surgery.</p></li>
<li><p>👴 my research interest is health services research - currently mostly with data from nursing homes.</p></li>
</ul>
