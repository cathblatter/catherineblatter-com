<p>My name is Catherine Blatter and I am a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>🏥 My clinical interests and expertise lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical nursing, more specifically general, thoracic and neurosurgery in a tertiary center</p></li>
<li><p>👴 👵 I also enjoyed working in a more rural
regional hospital with mostly older &amp; chronically ill patients - in particular because (in
my very own experience) patients and families have been more involved in any
decision making and “choosing wisely” was very popular.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>During my master’s studies and work at the <a href="https://nursing.unibas.ch">Institute of Nursing Science in Basel</a> I discovered a passion for coding in #rstats.</p>
<ul>
<li>💻 📈 My research interest lies in quality of care in health services research - especially by the use of data to improve quality of care and the physical and emotional health of health care workers.</li>
</ul>
