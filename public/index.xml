      <description>What is it about?
Some of my recent work includes writing the shurp2018-package.
This R package contains all the functions used to produce descriptive reports for a study called SHURP2018 - a research project at the Institute of Nursing Science. More information is found here: https://shurp.unibas.ch

      <description>💡 A collection of hints for working with Endnote this is a working document primarily addressed at students from the Institute of Nursing Science at University of Basel and may change over time - feedback welcome
What is this document and why? Endnote is the citation manager proclaimed in many courses at the INS. Over the past years I’ve encountered a number of struggles personally or through my peers. This document lists the major problems I’ve seen and offers solutions that worked for me.</description>

      <description>My name is Catherine Blatter and I am trained as a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland. I’m currently finishing my Master’s degree and working as a research assistant at the Institute of Nursing Science (INS) at the University of Basel.
 🏥 My clinical interests and expertise lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical nursing, more specifically general, thoracic and neurosurgery in a tertiary center
 👴 👵 I also enjoyed working in a more rural regional hospital with mostly older &amp;amp; chronically ill patients - in particular because “choosing wisely” was very popular and discussed often with patients and family members.</description>
