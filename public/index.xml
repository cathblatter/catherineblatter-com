      <description>What is it about?
Some of my recent work includes writing the shurp2018-package.
This R package contains all the functions used to produce descriptive reports for a study called SHURP2018 - a research project at the Institute of Nursing Science. More information is found here: https://shurp.unibas.ch

      <description>My name is Catherine Blatter and I am a registered general nurse (RN) located in Switzerland.
 üè• My clinical interests and expertise lie primarily in adult acute-care surgical nursing, more specifically general, thoracic and neurosurgery in a tertiary center
 üë¥ üëµ I also enjoyed working in a more rural regional hospital with mostly older &amp;amp; chronically ill patients - in particular because (in my very own experience) patients and families have been more involved in any decision making and ‚Äúchoosing wisely‚Äù was very popular.</description>
